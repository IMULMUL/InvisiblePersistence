## Code Standards

### Rust Style

- Use `rustfmt` for formatting

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Add doc comments for public APIs

### Documentation

- Update README.md if behavior changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update GUIDE.md for user-facing changes
- Include examples in doc comments

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for features
- Test error cases
- Aim for >70% coverage

### Security

- **NEVER commit private keys or wallets**
- Validate all external inputs
- Use secure random number generation
- Follow cryptography best practices
- Report security issues privately

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solana-trading-bots
cd solana-trading-bots

# Install dependencies
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run specific bot
cd sandwich-bot
cargo run -- --dry-run
```

## Architecture Guidelines

### Adding a New Bot

1. Create new directory: `new-bot/`
2. Add to workspace in root `Cargo.toml`
3. Follow structure of existing bots:
   ```
   new-bot/
   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bot.rs
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.rs
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
   â”œâ”€â”€ config.example.toml
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ GUIDE.md
   â””â”€â”€ tests/
   ```

### Adding Protocol Support

1. Create module in `protocols/`
2. Implement `ProtocolHandler` trait
3. Add configuration options
4. Write tests
5. Document usage

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize allocations in hot paths
- Use async/await efficiently
- Batch RPC calls when possible
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Profile before optimizing

## Community Guidelines

- Welcome newcomers
- Give constructive feedback
- Focus on ideas, not people
- No harassment or discrimination

### Communication

- Use GitHub Issues for bugs/features
- Use Discussions for questions
- Join Discord/Telegram for chat
- Be patient with responses

### Ethics

- Consider impact on DeFi ecosystem
- Don't promote harmful behavior
- Disclose risks and limitations
- Prioritize user safety
